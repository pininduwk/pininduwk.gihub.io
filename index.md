### LipNet
Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word classification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction

**Lip Reading App with Python Tensorflow and Streamlit:** This a step further and build it out into a full stack application using
streamlit python tensorflow  ([GitHub](https://github.com/pininduwk/LipNet/tree/main/app)).

### Training BERT Text Classifier on Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/pininduwk/BERT-Text-Classifier-on-TPU)

In this project, I fine-tuned the BERT language model using TensorFlow on Arabizi language text data. I modified the model architecture to improve its performance and trained it using Google's TPUs, which reduced the training time significantly. By completing this project, I gained experience in processing text data, using TensorFlow, and working with TPUs.

### Detect Non-negative Airline Tweets: BERT for Sentiment Analysis

[![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f32gj5IYIyFipoINiC8P3DvKat-WWLUK)

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>

### Detect Food Trends from Facebook Posts: Co-occurence Matrix, Lift and PPMI

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
