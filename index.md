## Computer Vision

### LipNet
Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word classification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction

This project is a computer vision-based football post detection algorithm. It uses two computer vision models, YOLO V7 for post detection and regular object detection for tracking the ball. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how computer vision can be used in sports.

### PointNet for 3D Object Classification in PyTorch
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/pininduwk/PointNet-for-3D-Object-Classification-PyTorch-)

In this project, I implemented a deep learning model called PointNet for 3D object classification using PyTorch. The PointNet model takes a set of 3D points that represent an object as input and outputs a label indicating the object's class. To train and test the model, I used a dataset of 3D shapes.

I loaded the dataset, preprocessed the data, defined and trained the PointNet model, and evaluated its performance on the test set. Additionally, I included visualization code to help understand the model's output.

By working on this project, I gained experience with implementing a deep learning model for 3D object classification using PyTorch and learned how to preprocess and visualize 3D data.

In this project, I fine-tuned the BERT language model using TensorFlow on Arabizi language text data. I modified the model architecture to improve its performance and trained it using Google's TPUs, which reduced the training time significantly. By completing this project, I gained experience in processing text data, using TensorFlow, and working with TPUs.
